# Human-Activity-Recognition-for-Life-Saving
I have created a human fall detector with the help of Pose estimation model OpenPifPaf and a trained LSTM model. The model shows accurate detection in the falling process. My model is able to detect falls in real-time. Some snaps of the working model is provided here.
